# Production WebSocket Chat - Implementation Plan
## AI Dating App: Real-time Chat with AI Matches

This is your working plan. Update checkboxes as you decide what to include/exclude.

---

## üí° Architecture Overview

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Rooms = Conversations** (1-to-1 with AI)
2. **Multi-Device Support** (one user, multiple websockets)
3. **ACK/NACK Pattern** (message reliability with user-controlled retries) ‚≠ê

### Conversations (Rooms)
- Each conversation with an AI match is a separate "room"
- `room_id` = `conversation_id` (e.g., "conv_user123_ai_alex")
- One user per conversation, but supports **multiple devices**
- User can have multiple conversations with different AI matches
- Messages isolated per conversation

### Multi-Device Support
- Same user connects from iPhone, iPad, web browser
- All devices join the same conversation room
- Messages/AI responses delivered to all user's devices
- Typing indicators synced across devices
- Connection tracking: `Dict[str, List[WebSocket]]`

### ACK/NACK Reliability Pattern ‚≠ê
**Why we chose ACK/NACK:**
- ‚úÖ **No DLQ needed** - Backend doesn't manage retry queues
- ‚úÖ **Simpler state** - Frontend tracks: sending/delivered/failed (3 states)
- ‚úÖ **User control** - User decides when to retry failed messages
- ‚úÖ **Clear feedback** - Immediate error notification on NACK
- ‚úÖ **DB confirmation** - ACK confirms message saved to database
- ‚úÖ **Easier debugging** - Clear success/failure signals

**Message Flow:**
```
User sends ‚Üí Backend validates ‚Üí Backend saves to DB ‚Üí Backend broadcasts
           ‚Üì                   ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
        If fail: NACK      If success: ACK      All devices get message
           ‚Üì                   ‚Üì
    User sees error      User sees delivered
    User can retry       Message confirmed
```

## üéØ Core Requirements (Must Have)

### Connection Management
- [ ] ConnectionManager class with proper state tracking
- [ ] User ID management (unique per user)
- [ ] Conversation support (room_id = conversation_id)
- [ ] Track active connections: `Dict[str, List[WebSocket]]` (user ‚Üí websockets for multi-device)
- [ ] Track conversation connections: `Dict[str, Set[str]]` (conversation_id ‚Üí user_ids)
- [ ] Handle multiple devices per user (same user_id, different websockets)

### Message Structure
- [ ] Pydantic models for all messages
- [ ] Message types enum (CHAT_MESSAGE, AI_RESPONSE, ACK, NACK, SYSTEM, ERROR, TYPING, etc.)
- [ ] Structured message format with:
  - [ ] type: MessageType
  - [ ] message_id: unique ID (UUID) - **required for ACK/NACK**
  - [ ] conversation_id: conversation ID
  - [ ] data: payload
  - [ ] timestamp: datetime
  - [ ] sender: client_id (optional)
- [ ] JSON send/receive (send_json, receive_json)

### ACK/NACK Pattern (Message Reliability)
- [ ] ACK message type - confirms successful processing
- [ ] NACK message type - indicates processing failure
- [ ] Send ACK when:
  - [ ] Message validated successfully
  - [ ] Message saved to database
  - [ ] Message broadcast completed
- [ ] Send NACK when:
  - [ ] Validation fails (invalid format, missing fields)
  - [ ] Database operation fails
  - [ ] Authorization fails (user not in conversation)
  - [ ] Rate limit exceeded
  - [ ] Any business logic error
- [ ] Include error details in NACK data field
- [ ] Frontend promise-based ACK handling
- [ ] Timeout handling (10 seconds default)
- [ ] Message status tracking: sending ‚Üí delivered/failed

**Why ACK/NACK:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler backend (no DLQ/retry logic needed)
- ‚úÖ Clearer frontend state management (3 states vs 4+)
- ‚úÖ User-controlled retries (better UX)
- ‚úÖ Immediate error feedback
- ‚úÖ Database persistence confirmation
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging and monitoring

### Reliability & Health
- [ ] Heartbeat mechanism (server ‚Üí client ping, client ‚Üí server pong)
- [ ] Heartbeat interval: configurable (default 30s)
- [ ] Heartbeat timeout: configurable (default 60s)
- [ ] Detect and close stale connections
- [ ] Background task for heartbeat monitoring
- [ ] Track last_heartbeat timestamp per connection

### Reconnection & Recovery
- [ ] Session ID tracking (different from connection)
- [ ] Detect reconnection (same client_id reconnects)
- [ ] Gracefully close old connection before accepting new
- [ ] Handle race conditions on reconnect
- [ ] Increment reconnection counter
- [ ] Client-side exponential backoff with jitter
- [ ] Max reconnection attempts (configurable)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Try/catch around all WebSocket operations
- [ ] Graceful handling of:
  - [ ] WebSocketDisconnect
  - [ ] JSONDecodeError (invalid message format)
  - [ ] ValidationError (Pydantic validation failure)
  - [ ] Connection send failures
- [ ] Send error messages to client on validation failure
- [ ] Logging with proper context (client_id, session_id, error)
- [ ] Don't crash server on single client error

### Graceful Shutdown
- [ ] Lifespan context manager
- [ ] Startup: initialize background tasks
- [ ] Shutdown: disconnect all clients with proper close code
- [ ] Shutdown: cancel background tasks
- [ ] Send GOING_AWAY close code to all clients
- [ ] Allow existing messages to complete before shutdown

### WebSocket Close Codes
- [ ] Enum for standard close codes:
  - [ ] 1000 NORMAL - Normal closure
  - [ ] 1001 GOING_AWAY - Server shutting down
  - [ ] 1002 PROTOCOL_ERROR - Protocol error
  - [ ] 1007 INVALID_DATA - Invalid frame payload
  - [ ] 1008 POLICY_VIOLATION - Policy violation
  - [ ] 1011 INTERNAL_ERROR - Server error
- [ ] Use proper close codes for different scenarios
- [ ] Include reason string in close frames

  - [ ] Total errors
  - [ ] Reconnection count
  - [ ] Message rate
  - [ ] Connection duration
- [ ] Per-room statistics
- [ ] Connection history (last N events)
- [ ] Error log (last N errors with context)

### Logging
- [ ] Structured logging configuration
- [ ] Log levels: INFO for normal, DEBUG for detailed
- [ ] Log connection events (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- [ ] Log errors with full context and stack traces
- [ ] Log message flow for debugging
- [ ] Use logger.exception() for exceptions

---

## üöÄ Performance & Scalability (Important)

### Async Best Practices

- [ ] Batch broadcasts (send to N clients at a time)
- [ ] Semaphore to limit concurrent operations
- [ ] Detect backpressure (buffer size)
- [ ] Use async for with websocket.iter_text()
- [ ] Don't block event loop
- [ ] Proper exception handling in async code

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Per-client message rate limiting
- [ ] Sliding window algorithm
- [ ] Track message timestamps per client
- [ ] Configurable: messages per window
- [ ] Configurable: time window (seconds)
- [ ] Clean up old timestamps
- [ ] Send rate limit error to client

### Connection Limits
- [ ] Max connections per IP (DDoS protection)
- [ ] Max total connections globally
- [ ] Track connections by IP address
- [ ] Reject new connections when limit reached
- [ ] Send appropriate close code and reason

## üîÑ Typical Flow (AI Dating App)

### User Opens Conversation
```
1. User opens app on iPhone
   ‚Üí ws.connect('ws://api.com/ws/user_123?conversation_id=conv_user123_ai_alex')

2. User also has iPad open with same conversation
   ‚Üí ws.connect('ws://api.com/ws/user_123?conversation_id=conv_user123_ai_alex')

3. Both connections in same conversation "room"
   ‚Üí ConnectionManager tracks 2 websockets for user_123 in conv_user123_ai_alex
```

### User Sends Message (With ACK/NACK)
```
1. User types on iPhone: "Hey Alex!"
   ‚Üí Frontend shows message as "sending" (grey check)
   ‚Üí WebSocket sends with message_id: "msg_12345"

2. Backend receives message
   ‚Üí Validates message
   ‚Üí Saves to database
   ‚Üí Broadcasts to conversation (iPhone + iPad get it)
   ‚Üí Sends ACK back to sender: { type: "ACK", message_id: "msg_12345" }

3. iPhone receives ACK
   ‚Üí Updates message status to "delivered" (green check)
   ‚Üí User knows message was processed successfully

4. iPad receives broadcast
   ‚Üí Shows message from iPhone immediately

---

If database fails:
2b. Backend tries to save ‚Üí Database error
    ‚Üí Sends NACK: { type: "NACK", message_id: "msg_12345", data: "DB error" }

3b. iPhone receives NACK
    ‚Üí Shows message as "failed" (red X)
    ‚Üí Shows retry button
    ‚Üí User taps retry ‚Üí Sends again with new message_id
```

### AI Response Flow
```
1. Your AI service generates response
   ‚Üí POST /api/send-ai-message
     {
       "conversation_id": "conv_user123_ai_alex",
       "message": "Hi! How's your day?",
       "message_id": "ai_msg_67890"
     }

2. WebSocket server receives
   ‚Üí Validates conversation exists
   ‚Üí Broadcasts to conversation
   ‚Üí Both iPhone and iPad receive AI response instantly
   ‚Üí Sends ACK back to AI service (confirms delivery initiated)
```

### Multi-Device Sync
```
All devices in same conversation get:
- User's own messages (sent from any device)
- AI responses
- Typing indicators
- Read receipts
- System messages
```

### Complete Message Exchange Example (ACK Success)
```json
// 1. Frontend ‚Üí Backend (User sends message)
{
  "type": "CHAT_MESSAGE",
  "message_id": "msg_abc123",
  "conversation_id": "conv_user123_ai_alex",
  "data": "Hey Alex, how are you?",
  "sender": "user_123",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

// 2. Backend validates, saves to DB, broadcasts

// 3. Backend ‚Üí Frontend (ACK to sender's device)
{
  "type": "ACK",
  "message_id": "msg_abc123",  // Same ID
  "conversation_id": "conv_user123_ai_alex",
  "data": "Message processed successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.123Z"
}

// 4. Backend ‚Üí All devices in conversation (Broadcast)
{
  "type": "CHAT_MESSAGE",
  "message_id": "msg_abc123",
  "conversation_id": "conv_user123_ai_alex",
  "data": "Hey Alex, how are you?",
  "sender": "user_123",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Complete Message Exchange Example (NACK Failure)
```json
// 1. Frontend ‚Üí Backend (User sends message)
{
  "type": "CHAT_MESSAGE",
  "message_id": "msg_xyz789",
  "conversation_id": "conv_user123_ai_alex",
  "data": "",  // Empty message!
  "sender": "user_123",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:31:00Z"
}

// 2. Backend validates ‚Üí Validation fails (empty message)

// 3. Backend ‚Üí Frontend (NACK to sender)
{
  "type": "NACK",
  "message_id": "msg_xyz789",  // Same ID
  "conversation_id": "conv_user123_ai_alex",
  "data": "Message cannot be empty",  // Error details
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:31:00.050Z"
}

// 4. Frontend receives NACK
//    ‚Üí Shows error toast: "Message cannot be empty"
//    ‚Üí Shows retry button
//    ‚Üí Keeps message text in input
```

### User Switches Conversations
```
User has 3 AI matches:
- Opens conversation with Alex ‚Üí conversation_id=conv_user123_ai_alex
- Switches to Sam ‚Üí Disconnects, reconnects with conversation_id=conv_user123_ai_sam
- Messages isolated per conversation
```

---

## üíª Frontend Implementation (ACK/NACK Pattern)

### Required Components

#### 1. Message State Management
```javascript
Message States:
- 'sending'   ‚Üí Grey single checkmark (waiting for ACK)
- 'delivered' ‚Üí Green double checkmark (got ACK)
- 'failed'    ‚Üí Red X with retry button (got NACK or timeout)
```

#### 2. Promise-Based Sending
```javascript
Features:
- sendMessage() returns Promise
- Promise resolves on ACK
- Promise rejects on NACK or timeout
- Store pending promises in Map<message_id, {resolve, reject}>
```

#### 3. Timeout Handling
```javascript
Configuration:
- Default timeout: 10 seconds
- Clear timeout on ACK/NACK
- Show retry button on timeout
- Keep message text in input on failure
```

#### 4. Retry Mechanism
```javascript
Features:
- Manual retry button for failed messages
- Generate new message_id on retry
- Optional: Auto-retry once on timeout, then show button
- Remove old failed message when retrying
```

#### 5. UI Components
```javascript
Required Elements:
- Message status indicator (checkmarks, X)
- Retry button
- Error toast/banner
- Loading state during send
```

### Frontend Checklist
- [ ] ChatManager class with pendingMessages Map

- [ ] Retry button implementation
- [ ] Error toast notifications
- [ ] Keep failed message text for retry
- [ ] Clear input only on successful send

---

## üìù Notes

- Review this plan and check/uncheck items based on your needs
- Add dating-app specific requirements as needed
- Update priorities based on your timeline
- Keep security placeholders for future integration
- Focus on solid ConnectionManager first - it's the foundation

### ACK/NACK Implementation Notes

**Backend Considerations:**
- Always send ACK/NACK - never leave client hanging
- Include meaningful error messages in NACK data field
- Log all NACK events for monitoring
- Consider rate limiting ACK/NACK messages (shouldn't be needed, but good practice)
- ACK should only be sent AFTER database persistence succeeds
- Use try/except around all business logic to catch errors for NACK

**Frontend Considerations:**
- Set reasonable timeout (10 seconds recommended)
- Clean up pending promises on component unmount
- Show loading state immediately on send
- Don't clear input field until ACK received
- Provide clear retry mechanism
- Consider auto-retry once on timeout, then manual retry
- Store failed messages locally in case user closes app

**Performance:**
- ACK/NACK adds one extra message per user message (~100 bytes)
- For 1000 messages/day: ~100KB extra traffic (negligible)
- Promise overhead is minimal (a few objects in memory)
- Timeout timers are cheap (event loop handles efficiently)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Clearer reliability guarantees
- ‚úÖ Simpler backend (no DLQ)
- ‚úÖ Better UX (immediate feedback)
- ‚ùå Slightly more complex frontend (promise management)
- ‚ùå One extra message per user message (tiny overhead)

### Integration with AI Service

**Option 1: AI Service Calls WebSocket Server (Recommended)**
```python
# Your AI service generates response, then:
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    await client.post('http://websocket-server/api/send-ai-message', json={
        'conversation_id': 'conv_user123_ai_alex',
        'message': ai_response,
        'type': 'AI_RESPONSE'
    })
# WebSocket server broadcasts to all user's devices
```

**Option 2: WebSocket Server Calls AI Service**
```python
# User sends message via WebSocket
# WebSocket server calls AI service:
ai_response = await ai_service.generate_response(message)
# Broadcast AI response back through WebSocket
```

**Recommendation:** Option 1 is more flexible and decouples services.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Check/uncheck what you need
2. **Prioritize** - Mark what's MVP vs nice-to-have
3. **Confirm architecture** - Multi-device + conversations makes sense?
4. **Ready?** - Tell me when to generate `main.py` with your requirements!

I'll create the production-ready `main.py` based on what you check off! üöÄ
